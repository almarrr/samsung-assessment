# Samsung Productgrid Demo

To run the Application, follow the steps below:

## Getting Started

First, you need to set environment variables. In the root, you'll find a file `.env.example`. Duplicate this file and rename the copy to `.env.local`. This new file will act as a local environment for the application.

## Installation

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies required for the application to run correctly.

## Running the Application

Once you've set up your environment variables and installed your dependencies, you're ready to start the application. In your terminal, type the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. Press `O` to open the application in your browser.

## Running Tests

I've included 2 example tests to help ensure the application runs as expected. To run these tests, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run test
```
